## Project 01 - Classification of Handwritten Digit using MNIST Data

The [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning. The MNIST acronym stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It has 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

## Project 02 - Landmark Classification (using CNN)

## Project 03 - Handwritten Digits Classifier using MNIST Data

The objective is to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews in three different languages - English, French, and Spanish. We have been given 30 movies, 10 in each language, along with their reviews and synopses in separate CSV files named `movie_reviews_eng.csv`, `movie_reviews_fr.csv`, and `movie_reviews_sp.csv`.

## Project 04 - Face Generation (using GANs)

In this project, I defined and trained a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) of your own creation on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate _new_ images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
