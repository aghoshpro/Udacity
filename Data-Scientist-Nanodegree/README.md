# Data Scientist Nanodegree

This repository contains all my solutions to the tutorials and projects of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). This course helped me to gain essential concepts and hands-on working experience with real world projects to be a Data scientist.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

I ran an exploratory data analysis utilizing a Wine Review dataset from Kaggle, which contained roughly 130k Wine Enthusiast reviews. I took this project as an opportunity to analyse the data and explain my results through a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@aghoshpro/sip-script-a-data-driven-journey-through-the-world-of-wine-d9d05d6dcf4e) post that provides insight into the questions posed.

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline

I applied my data engineering abilities to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight and create a model for an API that categorizes disaster notifications. I built a machine learning pipeline to categorizes genuine messages sent during disasters so that they could be routed to the right disaster aid agency. The project comprises a web interface that allows an emergency worker to enter a new message and receive classification results in multiple categories. The web application also shows data visualisations.

## Project 3: Recommendations with IBM

I looked at how people interacted with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and suggested new items that I believed they would find interesting. I carried out matrix factorization, EDA, Rank Based Recommendations, and User-user Based Collaborative Filtering.

## Project 4: Predicting Customer Churn for a Music Streaming Service

I forecasted customer attrition for a music streaming service using PySpark. A small subset (128MB) of the entire dataset (12GB) is being loaded and cleaned.
To comprehend the data and determine which features are helpful for churn prediction, exploratory data analysis is being conducted.
Using feature engineering to produce features for the modelling process
Modelling with machine learning methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes
