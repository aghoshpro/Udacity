# Generative AI Nanodegree

This repository contains all my solutions to the tutorials and projects of the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608). This course enabled me to go on a revolutionary journey into Generative AI! We'll start with an introductory course, then go on to mastering text generation using Large Language Models, unravelling the complexity of image creation in computer vision, and finally bringing AI to life in real-world applications. From foundational ideas to the development of complex chatbots and AI agents, this program will provide you with job-ready skills in the exciting subject of Generative AI.

**COMING SOON...**

## Project 1 - Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model

- Load a foundation model
- Identify and load a Hugging Face dataset for your particular task
- Utilize a state-of-the-art technique to adjust the foundation model's weights to meet the needs of your task, using a lightweight, parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that improves performance faster and more efficiently

## Project 2 - Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)

- Find and prepare a dataset that augments a foundation model's knowledge, from a source such as APIs, web scraping, or documents on hand
- Create a semantic search pipeline by implementing a custom Python vector similarity search algorithm to match user questions to relevant parts of the custom dataset
- Compose a custom query by combining the semantic search results with the user's question and send it to the foundation model

## Project 3 - AI Photo Editing with Inpainting

- Create a segmentation mask by differentiating between the subject and background of an image and create a matrix of pixels indicating the locations of these two components
- Given a text prompt and the pixel locations of the subject or background, replace part of the image with an AIgenerated image
- Connect your inpainting pipeline to a web interface that allows users to upload their own images and specify their own text prompts udacity

## Project 4 - Personalized Real Estate Agent

- Generate synthetic data using LLMs
- Embed property listing data in a vector database
- Perform semantic search over property listings against user preferences
- Design prompts and use RAG techniques to deliver personalized recommendations
